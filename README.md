# JpegEncoderPython
The aim of the project is the encoding a raw image using JPEG. The input is a raw image generally a bitmap(bmp).


1. Divide image into 8x8 blocks.
2. Apply DCT to each blocks.
3. Quantize each block with Psycohovisual Quantization Table.
4. Run-Length coding. (Find the repetitions.)
5. Huffman coding.
6. Write evertihing to a file.

## Todo
##### Zero shifting-Done.
##### Huffman coding-T1-Done.
##### Huffman coding-T2.
##### Huffman coding-T3.
##### It is for one chunk. I will do it for all image.
